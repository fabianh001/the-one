This scenario models the Unity party. To run the different scenarios, one has to select one of the predefined configuration files in the folder *./unity_party_scenarios* and load it in The One simulator. After the simulation was successfully completed, three reports about the location of guests, movement, andspreading are created. These reports can be found in the root directory the folder *./reportsUnity<ConfigurationName>*.

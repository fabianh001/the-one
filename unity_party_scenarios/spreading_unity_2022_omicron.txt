#
# Simulation with only vaccinated or recovered guests, January Unity 2022, applying 2g plus model with 100 percent fully vaccinated guests, 80 percent have the booster vaccine.
# The omicron variant is more infectious by about a factor 5 (probability = 0.01 instead of 0.0022), and vaccinated people have a slightly higher chance for infection.
#
# Recovered guests are counted as vaccinated guests due to the (slightly) better protection compared to unvaccinated guests
# --> 3 out of 4 vaccinated guests have booster vaccine ~ 80%
# --> Assume 80% percent of total guests with booster, 20% percent as fully vaccinated, but only with 2 shots (or recovered)
# Fully Vaccinated, tested and infected: 20% * 0.5% * 10% * 2000 = 0.0001 * 2000 ==> 0.2 ~ 1 infected vaccinated hosts
# Booster Vaccinated, tested and infected: 80% * 0.5% * 10% * 2000 = 0.0004 * 2000 = 0.8 ~ 1 infected, booster hosts
# assumption: ten percent of tested hosts with infections are not detected
# 2000 people, 0.0044, 2000 guests, 100% vaccinated, 80% booster, 0.5% infected, 10% of tested people have false negative test

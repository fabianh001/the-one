# Simulation with only vaccinated, tested (unvaccinated) or recovered guests, Unity 2021, applying 3g plus model with 60 percent fully vaccinated ratio
# --> Vaccinated and infected: 60% * 0.5% * 10% * 2000 = 0.0003 * 2000 ==> 0.6 ~ 1 infected vaccinated hosts
# 40% * 0.5% * 10% = 0.003 + 0,0002 = 0,4 infected, unvaccinated hosts ==> 1 infected, unvaccinated host
# assumption: ten percent of tested hosts with infections are not detected
#2000 people, 0.0022, 2000 guests, 60% fully vaccinated, 0.5% infected, 10% of tested people have false negative test
